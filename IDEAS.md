### Why React Omni?
* We want to develop a list of UI components that can be used across mobile and web.
* There are libraries such as Bootstrap and Foundation that aid developers with building responsive website.
* However, Brian and I imagine a day where developers can develop a application that will work as a native app and web app.
* This dream starts to become a reality when React and React Native was introduce.
* We believe developers should be able to build one interface that will work very well across different devices such as iOS and Android devices, web, desktop, tvOS etc.

### Challenges
* Building UI components that will work cross different devices is a challenge due to different screen sizes.
* A good user experience on mobile may not translate into a good experience on the web with the same interface and verse versa.
* Good news is that responsive design has been around for a few years now, again, thanks to library such as Bootstrap. This means we don't need to start from scratch.
* The most challenge part of user interface is navigation, hence, this is where our main focus will be first. People navigate differently on the web vs. mobile devices. Both Apple and Google also came up with their own design principle guideline. Should React Omni introduce a new design guideline or follow the platform specific design or ...?

### Open Questions
* Interface design looks different on iOS and Android. React Native takes that into consideration e.g Button component. Most web interface also has this specific look now due to library like Bootstrap. Should React Omni's UI component present a different style for web, iOS, Android as well?
* [Navigation Bar] Users navigate differently on the web vs. iOS vs. Android. These platform all have a standard default navigation (see iOS design guideline and material design guideline) Should we introduce a new interface that will work across all the platforms or build each one following their own design guideline?
